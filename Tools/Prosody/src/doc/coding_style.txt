This file describes some coding styles to try and adhere to when contributing to this project.
Please try to follow, and feel free to fix code you see not following this standard.

== Indentation ==

	1 tab indentation for all blocks

== Spacing ==

No space between function names and parenthesis and parenthesis and paramters:

		function foo(bar, baz)

Single space between braces and key/value pairs in table constructors:

		{ foo = "bar", bar = "foo" }

== Local variable naming ==

In this project there are many places where use of globals is restricted, and locals used for faster access.

Local versions of standard functions should follow the below form:

	math.random -> m_random
	string.char -> s_char	

== Miscellaneous ==

Single-statement blocks may be written on one line when short
	
	if foo then bar(); end

'do' and 'then' keywords should be placed at the end of the line, and never on a line by themself.
