This file documents the structure of the roster object.

table roster {
  [string bare_jid] = roster_item
}

table roster_item {
  string subscription = "none" | "to" | "from" | "both"
  string name = Opaque string set by client. (optional)
  set groups = a set of opaque strings set by the client
  boolean ask = nil | "subscribe" - a value of true indicates subscription is pending
}

The roster is available as
 hosts[host].sessions[username].roster
and a copy is made to session.roster for all sessions.

All modifications to a roster should be done through the rostermanager.
